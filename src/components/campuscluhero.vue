            The youth remains Africa's greatest asset. Africa’s youth population is
            rapidly growing and are expected to double to over 830 million by 2050. If
            properly harnessed, this increase in the working-age population could support
            increased productivity and more inclusive economic growth across the
            continent.

            But today, the majority of youth in Africa do not have stable economic
            opportunities.

            Of Africa’s nearly 420 million youth aged 15-35, one-third are unemployed and
            discouraged, another third are vulnerably employed, and only one in six is in
            wage employment. Youth face roughly doubles the unemployment rate of adults,
            with significant variation by country. (Source: Africa development bank)
